# Epigenome-wide association study of pregnancy exposure to green space and placental DNA methylation 

In this GitHub, you will find scripts for the analyses performed in this study. 

-   Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS):  You will find example scripts using the `PACEanalysis R package` (https://github.com/epicenteredresearch/PACEanalysis.git) for both continuous and categorical exposures.

    - Continuous exposure: EWASpla_GreenSpace_DataAnalysis.R
    - Categorical exposure: EWASpla_VisualGS_DataAnalysis.R

- Example in the main model of the Quality control (QC) of the EWAS results using the `EASIER R package`.
  
    -  QC_GSpla_EWAS.R
      
-	Example in NDVI100 main model of the Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using `dmrff R package`
  
    - GSPla_dmrff.R
